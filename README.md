This project involves building a basic offline blockchain. It includes tasks like extending the Proof-of-Work algorithm with parallelism, adapting the difficulty level, implementing mining preference settings, and adding custom extensions. The implementation is done in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. Tasks cover block creation, blockchain structure, transactions, digital signatures, and mining efficiency. The code creates blocks and manages transactions, ensuring security and authenticity. The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of blockchain concepts and their practical implementation.
